Portfolio Optimization in Python

This project consists of two files--"optimization.py" and "portfolios.py". The "optimization.py" file contains the class architecture for an object called PortOptimizer, which produces a Markowitz-efficient portfolio from a given set of assets. The "portfolios.py" file makes use of the class, comparing the risk/return characteristics of the optimal portfolio with the risk/return characteristics of 10,000 simulated portfolios.
